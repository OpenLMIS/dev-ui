# Modules
Modules in angular should describe and bind together a small unit of functionality. The OpenLMIS-UI build process should construct larger module units from theses small units.

## Documentation
Docs for modules must contain the module name and description. This should be thought of as an overview for the other obects within the module, and where appropriate gives an overview of how the modules fit together.
```
/**
 * @module module-name
 *
 * @description
 * Some module description.
 */
```
